# Tic-tac-toe

[Preview](http://tic-tac-toe-js-delta.vercel.app/)

## Description

This app was created to showcase and apply javascript learnings with the concept of creating functions. This application helped me understand more and exercised my mind in solving problems such as how to determine if X or O wins.

## Features

- Basic Mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe, which can be found [here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~bart/cs541-fall2001/homework/tictactoe-rules.html), but in this application O can also go first.
- After a game is finished, the players may be able to see movement history, wherein they can undo and redo the board itself to view the exact movement that happened.
- Lastly, it is also possible to time travel where the player can edit their movement when they undo their movement.
